# GAME-DOVLEPMENT-USING-MUTUAL-EXCLUSION
The Dino Game, popularized by its inclusion in the Google Chrome browser as a hidden Easter 
egg, features a dinosaur navigating through obstacles in a prehistoric landscape. Our goal is to 
introduce you to the basics of game development using PyCharm, guiding you through the 
process of setting up your project, creating game elements, implementing interactivity, and 
handling game mechanics
